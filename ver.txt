修复多尺度解码器
training with liae archi should be restarted
使用liae训练的模型必须重新来过

changed help for 'sort by yaw' option:
修改sort by yaw的帮助信息
NN will not learn src face directions that don't match dst face directions. Do not use if the dst face has hair that covers the jaw.
神经网络不会学习与dst面部方向不匹配的src面部。 如果dst脸部的头发覆盖下颚，请不要使用。

== 04.20.2019 ==

fixed work with NVIDIA cards in TCC mode
修复N卡 TCC模式

Converter: improved FAN-x masking mode.
转换器：优化Fan-x 遮罩模式
Now it excludes face obstructions such as hair, fingers, glasses, microphones, etc.
现在能排除那些脸部遮挡了，比如头发，手指，眼镜，麦克风，diao 等！

It works only for full face models, because there were glitches in half face version.
新功能仅适用于全脸模型，因为半脸版本有毛刺。

Fanseg is trained by using manually refined by MaskEditor >3000 various faces with obstructions.
Fanseg通过使用MaskEditor> 3000手工精制的各种面部障碍物进行训练而成。

Accuracy of fanseg to handle complex obstructions can be improved by adding more samples to dataset, but I have no time for that :(
通过向数据集添加更多样本可以提高fanseg处理复杂障碍物的准确性，但我没有时间:(没有时间：

Dataset is located in the official mega.nz folder.
训练的数据集就在官方mega.nz文件夹中。

If your fake has some complex obstructions that incorrectly recognized by fanseg,
如果你换脸的时候有一些复杂的障碍物被fanseg错误识别，

you can add manually masked samples from your fake to the dataset
你可以手动将你的样本添加到数据集中

and retrain it by using --model FANSEG argument in bat file. Read more info in dataset archive.
然后通过在BAT文件中添加 --moel FANSEG 参数重新训练。更多内容请看数据集。

Minimum recommended VRAM is 6GB and batch size 24 to train fanseg.
训练fanseg的推荐配置为，显存6GB，BS 24
Result model\FANSeg_256_full_face.h5 should be placed to DeepFacelab\facelib\ folder
训练完后需要将model\FANSeg_256_full_face.h5 放到DeepFacelab\facelib\替换同名文件。

Google Colab now works on Tesla T4 16GB.
谷歌云笔记本现在的配置是Tesla T4 16GB
With Google Colaboratory you can freely train your model for 12 hours per session, then reset session and continue with last save.
你可以使用谷歌云笔记本训练模型，但是回话会最多只能持续12小时，然后环境会充值。

== 04.07.2019 == 

Extractor: added warning if aligned folder contains files that will be deleted.

Converter subprocesses limited to maximum 6

== 04.06.2019 ==

added experimental mask editor. 
It is created to improve FANSeg model, but you can try to use it in fakes.
But remember: it does not guarantee quality improvement.
usage:
run 5.4) data_dst mask editor.bat
edit the mask of dst faces with obstructions
train SAE either with 'learn mask' or with 'style values'
Screenshot of mask editor: https://i.imgur.com/SaVpxVn.jpg
result of training and merging using edited mask: https://i.imgur.com/QJi9Myd.jpg
Complex masks are harder to train.

SAE: 
previous SAE model will not work with this update.
Greatly decreased chance of model collapse. 
Increased model accuracy.
Residual blocks now default and this option has been removed.
Improved 'learn mask'.
Added masked preview (switch by space key)

Converter: 
fixed rct/lct in seamless mode
added mask mode (6) learned*FAN-prd*FAN-dst

changed help message for pixel loss:
Pixel loss may help to enhance fine details and stabilize face color. Use it only if quality does not improve over time.

fixed ctrl-c exit in no-preview mode

== 03.31.2019 ==

Converter: fix blur region of seamless.

== 03.30.2019 == 

fixed seamless face jitter
removed options Suppress seamless jitter, seamless erode mask modifier.
seamlessed face now properly uses blur modifier
added option 'FAN-prd&dst' - using multiplied FAN prd and dst mask,

== 03.29.2019 ==

Converter: refactorings and optimizations
added new option
Apply super resolution? (y/n skip:n) : Enhance details by applying DCSCN network.

== 03.26.2019 ==

SAE: removed lightweight encoder.
optimizer mode now can be overriden each run

Trainer: the loss line now shows the average loss values after saving

Converter: fixed bug with copying files without faces.

XNViewMP : updated version

fixed cut video.bat for paths with spaces

== 03.24.2019 ==

old SAE model will not work with this update.

Fixed bug when SAE can be collapsed during a time. 

SAE: removed CA weights and encoder/decoder dims.

added new options:

Encoder dims per channel (21-85 ?:help skip:%d) 
More encoder dims help to recognize more facial features, but require more VRAM. You can fine-tune model size to fit your GPU.

Decoder dims per channel (11-85 ?:help skip:%d) 
More decoder dims help to get better details, but require more VRAM. You can fine-tune model size to fit your GPU.

Add residual blocks to decoder? (y/n, ?:help skip:n) : 
These blocks help to get better details, but require more computing time.

Remove gray border? (y/n, ?:help skip:n) : 
Removes gray border of predicted face, but requires more computing resources.


Extract images from video: added option
Output image format? ( jpg png ?:help skip:png ) : 
PNG is lossless, but produces images with size x10 larger than JPG.
JPG extraction is faster, especially on HDD instead of SSD.

== 03.21.2019 ==

OpenCL build: fixed, now works on most video cards again.

old SAE model will not work with this update.
Fixed bug when SAE can be collapsed during a time

Added option
Use CA weights? (y/n, ?:help skip: n ) :
Initialize network with 'Convolution Aware' weights. 
This may help to achieve a higher accuracy model, but consumes time at first run.

Extractor:
removed DLIB extractor
greatly increased accuracy of landmarks extraction, especially with S3FD detector, but speed of 2nd pass now slower.
From this point on, it is recommended to use only the S3FD detector.

Converter: added new option to choose type of mask for full-face models.

Mask mode: (1) learned, (2) dst, (3) FAN-prd, (4) FAN-dst (?) help. Default - 1 : 
Learned ?Learned mask, if you choose option 'Learn mask' in model. The contours are fairly smooth, but can be wobbly.
Dst ?raw mask from dst face, wobbly contours.
FAN-prd ?mask from pretrained FAN model from predicted face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
FAN-dst ?mask from pretrained FAN model from dst face. Very smooth not shaky countours.
Advantages of FAN mask: you can get a not wobbly shaky without learning it by model.
Disadvantage of FAN mask: may produce artifacts on the contours if the face is obstructed.

== 03.13.2019 ==

SAE: added new option

Optimizer mode? ( 1,2,3 ?:help skip:1) : 
this option only for NVIDIA cards. Optimizer mode of neural network.
1 - default.
2 - allows you to train x2 bigger network, uses a lot of RAM.
3 - allows you to train x3 bigger network, uses huge amount of RAM and 30% slower.

Epoch term renamed to iteration term.

added showing timestamp in string of training in console

== 03.11.2019 ==

CUDA10.1AVX users - update your video drivers from geforce.com site

face extractor:

added new extractor S3FD - more precise, produces less false-positive faces, accelerated by AMD/IntelHD GPU (while MT is not)

speed of 1st pass with DLIB significantly increased

decreased amount of false-positive faces for all extractors

manual extractor: added 'h' button to hide the help information

fix DFL conflict with system python installation

removed unwanted tensorflow info from console log

updated manual_ru

== 03.07.2019 ==
